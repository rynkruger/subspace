The Subspace icon. A circuitboard upon which is circular "window" to a small universe. 

The circuitboard is dark green. On top of it are light green stripes representing circuit wires, and underneath some of the light green wires are darker green strips. The light green wires branch off, and some of the branches terminate in small green circles. In the top-right corner, taking up approximately one quarter of the space, there is a circle representing a universe. It is very dark blue and contains a large yellow circle representing a star and a small blue circle representing a planet. The dark blue universe circle fades into the circuitboard. The yellow star circle fades into the blue circle, making it look like a light source. The small blue planet circle has a gradient which is lighter to the top-right (the side facing the star), making it look like a sphere being lit by the star.
