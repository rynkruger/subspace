# Team Organization Discussion

We need to figure out how we are going to organize our team and our discussions.

### Task Management
#### Motivations
 * Add tasks and bug-reports when we think of them so that they can be done later
 * Have a roadmap - plans and requests
 * Prioritize tasks and bug-fixes
 * Be aware of what other team-members are working on
    * Don't have two people working on the same thing at once
    * Know what to expect from others in near-future
    * Announce APIs so that dependent parts can be produced in the meanwhile
 * Keep sprints short, continuous integration

#### Possibilities
 * Put all open tasks in a single document, add (name) in parentheses for anyone currently working on it.
    Move to 'closed' document once done.
 * Put each task in a separate task document in a single directory. 
 * Combination of the above
 * Use of a tasking system, e.g. Jira (but something more accessible)
 
### Discussion and Commentary
#### Motivations
 * Discuss plans for the system
 * Give commentary on other people's plans in an easy to read fashion
 * Give commentary on other people's code during pull request
 
#### Possibilities
 * Use text-editor. Add replies by editing it inline and adding your name.
 * Use some online system which allows comments (e.g. Google docs)
 * Use pull-request and commentary feature of Github
 * Use a separate pull-request system
 
### Commits and Merges
#### Motivations
 * Don't have a messy history
 * Don't mess up the codebase
 * Be on the same page about this, be upfront so no one feels angry or insulted
 * Don't be critical
 
#### Possibilities
 * How much to branch?
 * Should we put in a pull-request for each feature? 
 * If using pull-requests, how long to wait before merging? 
 * Use merge? Rebase? Something else? 
 * Edit documents directly on the codebase?
 * Fork the codebase?
 
### Engine Focus
#### Motivations
 * Provide the ability for each of us to make the game we want using this engine.
 * Provide the ability for engine users to make a variety of games

#### Possibilities
 * Keep the engine very modular
 * Don't bake in something specific to your own game-idea or game-model
 * Do add a module that captures your game-idea / game-model
 * Design things so that they can be easily extended / altered later on.
 * Be aware of other team-members' aims
 * Be explicit about your own aims
