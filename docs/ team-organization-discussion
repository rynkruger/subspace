# Team Organization Discussion

We need to figure out how we are going to organize our team and our discussions.

### Task Management
 * To-Do List
 * Roadmap
 * Assignment of tasks

#### Possibilities
 * Put all open tasks in a single document, add (name) in parentheses for anyone currently working on it.
    Move to 'closed' document once done
 * Put each task in a separate task document.
 
### Commentary
 * Discussion
 * Pull-requests
